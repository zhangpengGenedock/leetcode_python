"""You have k lists of sorted integers in ascending order. Find the smallest range that includes at least one number
from each of the k lists.

We define the range [a,b] is smaller than range [c,d] if b-a < d-c or a < c if b-a == d-c.

Example 1: Input:[[4,10,15,24,26], [0,9,12,20], [5,18,22,30]] Output: [20,24] Explanation: List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24,
26], 24 is in range [20,24]. List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20], 20 is in range [20,24]. List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30], 22 is in range
[20,24]. Note: The given list may contain duplicates, so ascending order means >= here. 1 <= k <= 3500
-105 <= value
of elements <= 105. For Java users, please note that the input type has been changed to List<List<Integer>>. And
after you reset the code template, you'll see this point. """
