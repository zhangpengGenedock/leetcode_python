"""Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 â‰¤ i â‰¤ num calculate the number of 1's 
in their binary representation and return them as an array. 

Example:
For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2].

Follow up:

It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) 
/possibly in a single pass? Space complexity should be O(n). Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any 
builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language. """
